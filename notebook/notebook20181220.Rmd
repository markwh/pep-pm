Today I'm tying up loose ends. Writing. Start by updating the 3-paragraph outline from the writing-science exercise. Then summarize main results. Discussion will require some thinking, but that's something I can work on today. Need to get this presented so that I can move on to inversion theory.

Still need to finalize results. I wish I knew why these take so long to compute. Must be something to do with matrix multiplication time. TODO: switch to Matrix:: implementations. 

First priority is transferring results computation from notebook to script and properly caching the final result.
