```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Since optimizations are going very slow, I thought I'd try out microbenchmark on the objective and gradient. 

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)

foo <- mcflo_inps(swotlist = reachdata$SacramentoUpstream, fl = "metroman", 
                  mc = "metroman", metric = "nrmse")

f1 <- foo$f
g1 <- foo$g
args <- foo$p_init


microbenchmark(f1(args), g1(args))

```
