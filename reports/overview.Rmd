```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Pick a case to start with.

```{r}
testcase <- reachdata$Ganges
```

What are real Manning parameters?

- Space-constant n
- Space-varying n
- MetroMan depth-varying n


```{r}
source("../../mcfli-swotr/lib/manParams.R")
test_mp <- calcManParams(testcase)

test_mp$n
test_mp$A0
test_mp$logQbar



```

What is the resulting esitmate of discharge these give?

What are the resulting stats?


Build it up from simplest case. 

1. Area = true area
2. Area = calculated dA + true A0 (median)
3. Area = calculaed dA + optimal A0, based on Q SSE. 

We're at 2 axes of analysis with 3 variants each, for 9 total McMan assessments. 

Then there's AMHG.
