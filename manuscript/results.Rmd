What is the overall idea--do McFl methods work, as evaluated by performance metrics?

- summary statistics: max, median, min RRMSE, NRMSE for non-omniscient methods (4 mcfl methods x 2 metrics)

Is either one or the other responsible for poor McFLI performance? 

Evaluation of individual fl methods

- summary stats for omniscient flow law

Evaluation of individual mc methods

- summary stats for omniscient mass cons.
