Mass-conserved flow laws generally performed well within the target performance of 35% r/nRMSE, with all 16 cases having nRMSE < 35%, and all optimized, mass-conserved flow law cases having rRMSE < 35%. In addition, at most 2 of 16 cases exceeded the 35% rRMSE threshold using the physical/statistical parameters (Figure ####).
