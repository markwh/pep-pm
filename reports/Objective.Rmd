In a forward-McFLI, we can think of the evaluation metrics as objective functions by which to optimize the flow-law parameters. For a parameter set $\theta$, we have the following optimizations:

- **RRMSE**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\theta} &= \arg \min_\theta RRMSE(\hat{Q}(\theta) , Q) \\
&= \arg \min_\theta \sum_t \Bigg( \frac{\hat{Q_t}(\theta) - Q_t}{Q_t} \Bigg)^2 \\
&= \arg \min_\theta \sum_t \Bigg( \Big[\frac{\hat{Q_t}(\theta)}{Q_t}\Big]^2 - 2 \frac{\hat{Q}_t(\theta)}{Q_t} \Bigg)
\end{aligned}

$$



- **nRMSE**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\theta} &= \arg \min_\theta nRMSE(\hat{Q}(\theta) , Q) \\
&= \arg \min_\theta \sum_t \Big( \hat{Q_t}(\theta) - Q_t \Big)^2
\end{aligned}
$$


This is the same as minimizing squared error. RRMSE is, to a first-order approximation, equivalent to minimizing squared error of logQ.
