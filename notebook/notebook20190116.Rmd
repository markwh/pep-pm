```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Modifying optimizations to do a "partial" optimization using real (nown) A0, unknown Manning parameters. 

Here's copied from my regular work notes:

I think it's easiest to add an argument to fl function factories that toggles A0 truth. 

- OK, first crack at that is done. 
- Next, make needed changes in wrapper function. DONE.
- Finally, propagate real_A argument through starting at mcflob()

(end copy)

Time to test it out!

```{r}
testinps <- mcflo_inps(swotlist = reachdata$Ganges, fl = "metroman", 
                       mc = "metroman", method = "part_optim", metric = "rrmse")

testinps$p_stat
testinps$f(params = testinps$p_stat)

testoptim <- mcflo_optim(testinps, control = list(trace = 3))
```
